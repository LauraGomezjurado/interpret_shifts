## üîç Attribution Drift Analysis

### SVHN Attribution Consistency
The model shows **LOW** attribution consistency when transitioning from CIFAR-10 to SVHN:

| Method | IoU Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Saliency** | 0.156 | Poor consistency |
| **Integrated Gradients** | 0.156 | Poor consistency |
| **GradCAM** | 0.000 | Not working (likely due to architecture) |
| **Attention Rollout** | 0.000 | Not working (likely due to architecture) |

**Average IoU:** 0.156 (Low consistency level)

### Corruption Robustness
The model shows varying robustness to different types of corruptions:

#### Gaussian Noise
- **Severity 1:** 60.4% accuracy
- **Severity 3:** 26.0% accuracy

#### Brightness Changes
- **Severity 1:** 65.6% accuracy (most robust)
- **Severity 3:** 26.0% accuracy

#### Contrast Changes

## üö® Risk Assessment: **HIGH RISK**

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Massive Performance Drop:** 60.8% accuracy loss on OOD data
2. **Poor Calibration:** Model is overconfident on OOD samples
3. **Attribution Instability:** Low consistency in explanation methods
4. **Limited Robustness:** Significant degradation under corruptions

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Implement OOD Detection:** Deploy uncertainty-based detection before using model predictions
2. **Add Calibration:** Use temperature scaling or Platt scaling to improve calibration
3. **Ensemble Methods:** Consider using multiple models to improve robustness

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Robustness Training:** Implement adversarial training or data augmentation
2. **Architecture Changes:** Consider more robust architectures or larger models
3. **Uncertainty Quantification:** Add Bayesian layers or dropout for better uncertainty estimates

## üî¨ Technical Insights

### Attribution Method Analysis:
- **Saliency and Integrated Gradients** show similar low consistency (IoU ‚âà 0.156)
- **GradCAM and Attention Rollout** failed to produce meaningful attributions (likely due to ViT architecture incompatibility)
- The low IoU scores indicate that the model's decision-making process changes significantly between domains

### Corruption Analysis:
- **Contrast changes** are handled best by the model
- **Gaussian noise** causes the most severe degradation
- **Brightness changes** show moderate impact
- The model maintains some robustness at low corruption severities but fails at higher severities

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **The ViT model is not ready for deployment** on data that differs from CIFAR-10
2. **Attribution methods are unreliable** for explaining model decisions on OOD data
3. **Calibration is severely compromised** on OOD samples, making confidence scores unreliable
4. **Robustness training is essential** before considering real-world deployment

This analysis demonstrates the critical importance of OOD evaluation and the need for robust model development practices in computer vision applications.
