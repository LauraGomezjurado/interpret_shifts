## üéØ Project Overview

This comprehensive study investigates how deep learning models behave when faced with distribution shifts, with a particular focus on:

1. **Model Performance Degradation** under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions
2. **Attribution Method Robustness** across different data distributions
3. **Semantic Coherence** of model predictions on unfamiliar data
4. **Calibration Reliability** for confidence estimation

### Key Research Questions Addressed:
- How do attribution methods change when models encounter unfamiliar data?
- Can attribution drift serve as an indicator of distribution shift?
- What are the risks of deploying models without OOD detection?
- How do different architectures (ViT vs ResNet) handle distribution shifts?

## üîç Key Findings

### 1. Catastrophic Performance Degradation

**Vision Transformer Results:**
- **CIFAR-10 (ID) Accuracy:** 72.74%
- **CIFAR-100 (OOD) Accuracy:** 1.01%
- **Performance Drop:** 71.73% (near-random performance)

**Critical Insight:** The model achieves reasonable performance on familiar data but completely fails on semantically related but unfamiliar classes, demonstrating the brittleness of current deep learning approaches.

### 2. Severe Calibration Breakdown

**Expected Calibration Error (ECE):**
- **CIFAR-10:** 0.0354 (well-calibrated)
- **CIFAR-100:** 0.5983 (severely miscalibrated)
- **Increase:** 16.9√ó degradation

**Dangerous Implication:** The model maintains high confidence (61.9% mean) while being almost entirely wrong, creating a "confident but incorrect" scenario that's particularly dangerous for real-world deployment.

### 3. Attribution Method Robustness Analysis

| Method | IoU Similarity | Status | Key Finding |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| **Saliency Maps** | 0.153 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate drift | Most robust gradient method |
| **Integrated Gradients** | 0.150 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate drift | Theoretically sound but drifts |
| **Grad-CAM** | 0.000 | ‚ùå Complete failure | Incompatible with ViT architecture |
| **Attention Rollout** | 0.000 | ‚ùå Implementation issues | Requires architecture-specific fixes |

**Key Discovery:** Attribution methods are not robust across distributions, with 84.7% dissimilarity between ID and OOD explanations, suggesting that model interpretations become unreliable precisely when we need them most.

### 4. Semantic Incoherence Patterns

**Prediction Bias Analysis:**
- **Animal classes dominate:** 51.4% of predictions (Cat: 16.8%, Deer: 12.8%, Dog: 12.4%)
- **Vehicle classes underrepresented:** 9.8% of predictions
- **Semantic mapping examples:**
  - CIFAR-100 "cloud" ‚Üí CIFAR-10 "airplane" (somewhat logical)
  - CIFAR-100 "snail" ‚Üí CIFAR-10 "cat" (poor semantic alignment)

**Interpretation:** The model learned animal-specific features more robustly than vehicle features, leading to systematic biases in OOD predictions.

### 5. Cross-Dataset Validation

**CIFAR-100 vs SVHN Comparison:**
- Similar attribution drift patterns across both OOD datasets
- Saliency IoU: 0.153 (CIFAR-100) vs 0.158 (SVHN)
- Suggests consistent behavior across different types of distribution shifts

## üéØ Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis reveals that **current deep learning models exhibit dangerous overconfidence when faced with distribution shifts**, while their explanation methods become unreliable precisely when interpretability is most needed. The combination of catastrophic performance degradation (71.73% accuracy drop) with maintained high confidence (61.9%) creates a perfect storm for deployment failure.

**The central message is clear:** AI systems require fundamental improvements in robustness, uncertainty quantification, and OOD detection before they can be safely deployed in real-world scenarios where distribution shifts are inevitable.

This work provides both a sobering assessment of current limitations and a roadmap for building more reliable, interpretable, and safe AI systems. The methodological framework developed here can serve as a foundation for future research into distribution shift robustness and attribution method reliability.

**Bottom Line:** We must move beyond accuracy-focused evaluation to comprehensive robustness assessment that includes performance, calibration, interpretability, and semantic coherence across diverse data distributions.
