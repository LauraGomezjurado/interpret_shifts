## 1. Performance Analysis

### 1.1 Accuracy Metrics
| Dataset | Accuracy | Samples | Performance Drop |
|---------|----------|---------|------------------|
| CIFAR-10 (ID) | **72.74%** | 10,000 | - |
| CIFAR-100 (OOD) | **1.01%** | 10,000 | **-71.73%** |

**Key Findings:**
- The model achieves reasonable performance on in-distribution data (72.74%)
- **Near-random performance** on CIFAR-100 (1.01% vs. 1% random chance for 100 classes)
- This represents one of the most severe distribution shifts observed in computer vision

### 1.2 Calibration Analysis
| Dataset | Expected Calibration Error (ECE) | Calibration Quality |
|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| CIFAR-10 (ID) | **0.0354** | Well-calibrated |
| CIFAR-100 (OOD) | **0.5983** | Severely miscalibrated |

**Calibration Breakdown:**
- **16.9x increase** in calibration error on OOD data
- Model exhibits extreme overconfidence on incorrect predictions
- ECE > 0.5 indicates the model is essentially unreliable for confidence estimation

## 2. Attribution Drift Analysis

### 2.1 Method-Specific Drift Metrics

| Attribution Method | IoU Similarity | Pearson Correlation | Spearman Correlation | Status |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Saliency Maps** | 0.153 | 0.106 | 0.104 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate drift |
| **Integrated Gradients** | 0.150 | 0.006 | 0.004 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate drift |
| **Grad-CAM** | 0.000 | null | 1.000 | ‚ùå Complete failure |
| **Attention Rollout** | 0.000 | null | 1.000 | ‚ùå Complete failure |

### 2.2 Attribution Intensity Analysis

**Saliency Maps:**
- CIFAR-10 intensity: 0.0201
- CIFAR-100 intensity: 0.0264
- **Intensity ratio: 1.32** (31% increase on OOD data)

**Integrated Gradients:**
- CIFAR-10 intensity: 0.0254
- CIFAR-100 intensity: 0.0281
- **Intensity ratio: 1.10** (10% increase on OOD data)

**Interpretation:**
- Higher attribution intensity on OOD data suggests model uncertainty
- Saliency maps show more dramatic changes than Integrated Gradients
- Both methods remain functional, unlike Grad-CAM and Attention Rollout

## 3. Semantic Coherence Analysis

### 3.1 Prediction Distribution
The model's predictions on CIFAR-100 show interesting biases:

| CIFAR-10 Class | Prediction Count | Percentage |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Cat | 84 | 16.8% |
| Deer | 64 | 12.8% |
| Dog | 62 | 12.4% |
| Frog | 57 | 11.4% |
| Truck | 54 | 10.8% |
| Airplane | 53 | 10.6% |
| Bird | 47 | 9.4% |
| Horse | 30 | 6.0% |
| Ship | 26 | 5.2% |
| Automobile | 23 | 4.6% |

**Key Observations:**
- Strong bias toward animal classes (Cat, Deer, Dog, Bird: 51.4% of predictions)
- Underrepresentation of vehicle classes (Ship, Automobile: 9.8% of predictions)
- This suggests the model learned animal-specific features more robustly

### 3.2 Confidence Analysis
- **Mean confidence:** 0.619 (moderately high despite poor accuracy)
- **Standard deviation:** 0.195
- **Low confidence ratio:** 32% (predictions with confidence < 0.5)

**Critical Issue:** The model maintains relatively high confidence (61.9%) while being almost entirely wrong, indicating severe overconfidence.

### 3.3 Semantic Mapping Analysis
Examples of how CIFAR-100 classes map to CIFAR-10 predictions:

**Airplane predictions** ‚Üí Cloud, Sea, Ray (somewhat logical for sky/water contexts)  
**Cat predictions** ‚Üí Snail, Wolf, Lamp (mixed semantic coherence)  
**Truck predictions** ‚Üí House, Oak tree, Bicycle (poor semantic alignment)

## 4. Corruption Robustness Analysis

### 4.1 Performance Under Corruptions

| Corruption Type | Severity 1 | Severity 3 | Severity 5 | Degradation Pattern |
|----------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Gaussian Noise** | 54.7% | 20.7% | 16.3% | Severe degradation |
| **Brightness** | 63.3% | 24.3% | 12.0% | Severe degradation |
| **Contrast** | 66.3% | 56.7% | 43.3% | Gradual degradation |
| **Fog** | 69.0% | 69.0% | 69.0% | No degradation* |
| **Frost** | 69.0% | 69.0% | 69.0% | No degradation* |

*Note: Fog and Frost showing identical results suggests implementation issues in corruption generation.

### 4.2 Attribution Drift Under Corruptions

**Most Robust:** Contrast corruptions maintain reasonable attribution similarity (IoU: 0.51 at severity 1)  
**Least Robust:** Gaussian noise causes significant attribution drift (IoU: 0.23 at severity 1)

---

## 5. Cross-Dataset Comparison: CIFAR-100 vs SVHN

| Method | CIFAR-100 IoU | SVHN IoU | Difference | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|----------|------------|----------------|
| Saliency | 0.153 | 0.158 | -0.005 | Similar drift magnitude |
| Integrated Gradients | 0.150 | 0.157 | -0.007 | Similar drift magnitude |

**Finding:** CIFAR-100 and SVHN produce remarkably similar attribution drift patterns, suggesting both represent significant but comparable distribution shifts.

## 6. Technical Issues Identified

### 6.1 Attribution Method Failures
- **Grad-CAM:** Complete failure due to ViT architecture incompatibility
- **Attention Rollout:** Implementation issues preventing proper attention extraction
- **Root Cause:** ViT's transformer architecture lacks the convolutional layers that Grad-CAM requires

### 6.2 Sanity Check Results
- **Saliency:** Failed sanity check (correlation = -0.012)
- **Integrated Gradients:** Passed completeness check (error = 0.4388)
- **Implication:** Only Integrated Gradients provides theoretically sound attributions

## 9. Conclusions

This analysis reveals **fundamental robustness issues** in the Vision Transformer model when faced with distribution shift. The combination of:

- **Catastrophic accuracy drop** (71.73%)
- **Severe miscalibration** (16.9x ECE increase)
- **Moderate attribution drift** (84.7% dissimilarity)
- **Maintained overconfidence** (61.9% mean confidence despite 1% accuracy)

Creates a **perfect storm for deployment failure**. The model exhibits the dangerous combination of being wrong and confident about it.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Distribution shift detection is critical** for safe AI deployment
2. **Attribution methods are not robust** across distributions
3. **Model confidence is not a reliable indicator** of correctness on OOD data
4. **Architecture-specific attribution methods** are necessary for proper interpretability

### Scientific Contribution:
This analysis provides empirical evidence that:
- Vision Transformers suffer from severe overconfidence on OOD data
- Attribution drift can serve as a complementary OOD detection signal
- Current interpretability methods have significant limitations in real-world scenarios

**Recommendation: Do not deploy this model without robust OOD detection and human oversight mechanisms.**
